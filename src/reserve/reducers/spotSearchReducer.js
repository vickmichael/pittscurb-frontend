The cocktails were speedy and delicious. We’ve had cocktails in many bars in Pittsburgh and these were some of, if not the best around.  The small plates and large plates were spectacular - great Eastern European / Polish food.  We love that it’s all vegan!!!  Service was fast and efficient.   Thank you!!',

I’d recommend any of the cocktails because they are some of the best I’ve had in Pittsburgh, but you also must try their desert menu. We had this pastry thing that brought me back to my childhood eating toaster strudels but with enough icing! It’s also worth reminding that this is a vegan restaurant, but as someone who regularly eats meat, I didn’t miss it here.',
